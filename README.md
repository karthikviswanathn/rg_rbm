# Real Space Renormalization and Applications to Machine Learning
This repository contains the bachelor thesis of Karthik Viswanathan on *Real Space Renormalization and Applications to Machine Learning*.  

## Abstract
The concept of renormalization group(RG) theory has been extensively used to solve
problems in condensed matter physics , phase transitions and high energy physics. RG
is an iterative coarse-graining scheme that allows for the extraction of relevant features
as a physical system is examined at different length scales. Here, we explore the possibility of applying RG concepts in deep learning. In recent times, a lot of deep learning
techniques have yielded record-breaking results on a diverse set of difficult machine
learning tasks in computer vision, speech recognition, and natural language processing.
Despite this enormous success at feature extraction, there is very less theoretical understanding as to the reason behind this success. We attempt to shed light on some of the
reasons behind the success of Restricted Boltzmann Machines(RBMs) using RG.

Chapter 1 gives a brief introduction to phase transitions in general and Ising model
in particular. Chapter 2 introduces Renormalization Group Theory and deals with various attempts to solve the 2D Ising model problem using RG. We talk about the applications of RG in explaining the working of RBMs in chapter 3. We conclude the report
by stating further work that could be done in this field.
